# Feature Implementation Command

## Purpose

This command guides the implementation of new full-stack features using **minimal iteration cycles**. Each workflow run should implement the smallest possible increment that provides measurable value while maintaining the system's quality standards.

You are responsible for making sure all steps are done according to the workflow steps description below.
All steps MUST complete, and they must be completed in the order described below.
You are only allowed to move to the next step after the previous step has reported DONE.

The Jira issue key for the feature to implement is in $ARGUMENTS.

IMPORTANT: The workflow steps will report to you when they're done, and only then can the next step start. Do not stop until the workflow is completed.
Create a TODO list for the workflow steps, and follow it.

## Workflow Steps

1. Read `CLAUDE.md`: General principles, quality gates, and development workflow
2. Create a state management file for this increment - run the .claude/commands/create-state-management-file.md command, passing $ARGUMENTS as argument to it
3. Read Jira Issue - run the .claude/commands/read-issue.md command, passing the state management file as argument to it
4. Define implementation plan - run the .claude/commands/define-implementation-plan.md command, passing the state management file as argument to it
5. Write specification - run the .claude/commands/write-specification.md command, passing the state management file as argument to it
6. Get sign-off on specification. You are not allowed to go to step 7 until the user has signed off on the specification. Run the .claude/commands/specification-signoff.md command, passing the state management file as argument to it
7. Check out new branch - run the .claude/commands/git-checkout.md command, passing the state management file as argument to it
8. Implement increment - run the .claude/commands/implement-increment.md command, passing the state management file as argument to it
9.  Perform code review - run the .claude/commands/code-review.md command, passing the state management file as argument to it. If the verdict of the code review is NEEDS_CHANGES, address comments and then run the implement increment step again.
Repeat as needed.
10.  Create pull request - run the .claude/commands/create-pull-request.md command, passing the state management file as argument to it
21.  Review pull request - run the .claude/commands/review-pull-request.md command, passing the state management file as argument to it

**If Jira operations fail**:
- Continue with local specification files
- Log Jira errors but don't block development
- Manually update Jira status if needed
