# Code Review Command

## Purpose

Review code changes for the active increment and give a verdict of NEEDS_CHANGES or APPROVED.
This command is called by an orchestrating command, and is one of the steps in a larger workflow.
You MUST follow all workflow steps below, not skipping any step and doing all steps in order.

## Workflow Steps

When this command is run with a state management file as $ARGUMENTS.

1. Read state management file to understand the context for what you need to review

2. Read the specification linked in the state management file

3. Analyze current codebase against the specification requirements

4. Verify completion criteria:
   - [ ] Single behavior is fully implemented
   - [ ] All quality gates pass (see below)
   - [ ] No breaking changes introduced
   - [ ] Feature works in both development and build modes
   - [ ] Business rules are enforced consistently

5. Ultrathink about your findings and provide detailed feedback:
   - What's implemented correctly
   - What's missing or incomplete
   - Any issues found
   - Specific next steps if changes needed

6. Final verdict: APPROVED or NEEDS_CHANGES with clear reasons

7. Once APPROVED, add a comment to the Linear issue describing the findings and verdict, using `linear:create_comment`

8. Report DONE to the orchestrating command.

## Review Process

### Specification Alignment
- Compare implemented behavior vs. specified behavior
- Verify no scope creep beyond the minimal increment
- Check adherence to domain principles

### Code Quality
- Review test coverage and quality
- Check domain model consistency
- Verify error handling
- Assess code organization

### Integration
- Verify frontend/backend integration if applicable
- Check build pipeline success
- Validate development/production compatibility

### Quality Gates

Run all quality gates and verify that they pass.

## Output Format

Provide structured feedback:
- **Summary**: Brief status
- **Completed**: What works correctly
- **Issues Found**: Specific problems
- **Missing**: What still needs implementation
- **Next Steps**: Actionable items
- **Decision**: APPROVED or NEEDS_CHANGES
